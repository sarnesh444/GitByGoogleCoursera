DIFF FILE
"filename.diff" stores the differences between the two files 

to generate a diff file
eg."diff -u disk_usage_original.py disk_usage_fixed.py > disk_usage.diff" gives the differences between original and modified file and copies them into a .diff file which can later be used with patch command


PATCH:
"patch fileyouwantoapplychangesto < difffile" this will move all the changes from .diff file to fileyouwanttoapplychangesto


eg."patch disk_usage.py < disk_usage.diff" with this command the changes in disk_usage.diff(obtained by getting the differences between original file which had bugs and fixed file free from bugs) 
are applied to disk_usage.py
