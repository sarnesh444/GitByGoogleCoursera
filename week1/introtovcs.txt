VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
aka source control management
====================== 


A Version Control System keeps track of the changes that we make to our files. 
By using a VCS, we can know when the changes were made and who made them. 
It also lets us easily revert a change if it turned out not to be a good idea. 
It makes collaboration easier by allowing us to merge changes from lots of different sources.

However, unlike a regular file server which only saves the most recent version of a file, a VCS keeps track of all the different versions that we create as we save our changes. 


On top of this, we can make edits to multiple files and treat that collection of edits as a single change which is commonly known as a, commit. 


When a change is encountered and is causing issues we can rollback to the one which is healthy
