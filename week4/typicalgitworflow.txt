TYPICAL PULL REQUEST WORKFLOW ON GITHUB FOR A FORKED REPO
=========================================================

NOW FORKED REPO ACTS AS REMOTE

1.Fork the repo you would like to contribute to 

2.clone the repo into local storage

3.create a new branch to make any changes

4.make changes/create new files here

5.stage the changes using git add

6.commit using git commit

7.to push the change to our forked remote repo we need to create the remote branch
"git push -u origin <branchname>"

8.now we can create pull request in the GUI itself

if there were merge conflicts we will have to rebase our changes against current branch of original repo
clear description helps the person who will approve change understand why they should merge the change into the main tree
