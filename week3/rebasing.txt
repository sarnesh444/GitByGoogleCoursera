REBASING

once the remote branch properly works it can be merged with master branch

1."git rebase "-rebasing means changing the base commit used for our branch

note:merge basic stuff
"when we create a branch at a certain point,git knows the latest commit that has been submitted on both branches"
"if only one of the branches has new changes when we try to merge them git will be able to fast forward and apply changes "
"but if both branches have new changes when we try to merge git will create a new merge commit for the three way merge"

FOR SUCH A THREE WAY MERGE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEBUG

"by changing the base where our commits split we can replay the new commits on top of the new base"-allowing git to do a fast forward merge and keeps history linear

"git rebase <branchthatwewantosetasnewbase>"


2."git push --delete origin branchname"-deletes the remote branch

3."git branch -d branchname"-deletes the branch locally


“git rebase refactor”
Moves the current branch on top of the refactor branch
